# Java-Sorting-Algorithms
By Erik Davis

This Java application generates three lists of 50000 random integers and then implements three sorting algorithms to sort these lists, determining the time in milliseconds to sort each one. The sorting algorithms implemented are Selection Sort, Shell Sort, and Quick Sort. The results are outputted to a formatted text file in the output folder.
